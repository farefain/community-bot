       "'Hello Folks,\\n\\nQuick question. I have purchased DNA Advantage licenses for Cisco SD-Access deployment. With SD-Access, we already have ISE 3.x Essential licenses. The question is do I also need to purchase ISE Advantage license? As mentioned on Cisco ISE 3.x licensing structure, it says that to use pxGrid (with DNA-C - no pxGrid Cloud required in my case) and TrustSec (Group-based Access Policy), I need ISE advantage licenses. Can someone please clarify based on their experience. |||| check this matrix will helo you depends what feature you looking to implement :\\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/m/en_uk/products/software/dna-subscription-switching/en-sw-sub-matrix-switching.html Hello All,\\nStarting to get into ISE and DNA and a couple of queries if someone can point me in the right direction. There is a lot of content on both subjects and I cant quite piece together where DNA Center is necessary when it comes to SDA. For example do I need DNA Center to implement Trustsec, SGT\\'s and Posture? From what I can determine ISE covers this and DNA Center is more monitoring along with some Admin integration or am I miss-understanding.\\nAlso, from a licensing perspective if I were to use Cisco 9200\\'s in my lab for my edge switches to achieve SGT and Posture I just need the Network Essential\\'s or is it necessary to have Network Advantage licensing? I appreciate I\\'ll need the DNA Advantage term license but not be needed if DNA Center not used.\\nHas anyone a link that explains in more detail or a brief summary?\\nThanks in advance\\nDave |||| Hi Dave. Manually (by hand on the CLI, without DNA Center) deployed wired and wireless Cisco infra with ISE will give you capability to implement Group-Based Policy (aka TrustSec), SGT and posture.\\nNetwork Advantage and DNA Advantage is required for GBP in C9K switches.\\nIf you choose to proceed with DNA Center and SD-Access you will get automation of the fabric (no manual deployment) which natively support GBP and Network Virtualisaiton, Assurance, Endpoint Analytics, Trust Analytics and Group-Based Policy Analytics. If you\\'re not sure what those things are then searching some of the most recent presentations on ciscolive.com would be a good way to learn.\\nIn short: deployment and visibility of campus networks, GBP and SGT is easier with DNA Center. |||| Thanks jedolphiI appreciate you providing some clarity which is very helpful.

I can see them in the Software Central.2xCisco ISE Virtual Machine Medium with SKU R-ISE-VMM-K9= and no product instances mapped. Means 2 of 2 are available.That makes sense for me.But the ISE server seems to request a different thing from the smart licensing system.The license is called only \"ISE VM\" if I check the product instance of my ISE.If I search in the licenses folder of my virtual account, I also see these two names for the VM licenses.Seems that Cisco has a naming mismatch here? How can I fix that?Thanks a lot! |||| You need to convert them to the VM Common (VMC License). A licensing TAC Case should be able to help out.

Essential, Advantage or Premier?\\nThanks\\nMarco Hello,\\nI\\'m finding pxgrid license information very confusing.\\nOn the ordering guide, table 2 says pxgrid does not consume a license but on the license guide it states the following:\\n\"pxGrid is used to share context collected by ISE with other products. A Plus license is required to enable pxGrid functionality. There is no session count decrement when context for session is shared. However, to use pxGrid, the number of Plus sessions licensed must be equal to the number of Base sessions licensed. For more information, see Cisco ISE Licenses and Services section inCisco Identity Services Engine Ordering Guide.\"\\nIn my deployment i see zero PLUS licenses being consumed despite using pxgrid for context sharing with third-party solutions.\\nNow I\\'m due to renew my Plus licenses, can I assume I could renew only the bare minimum for Pxgrid to be active or it should be the same number I currently have for BASE? |||| Enforcement != Compliance. pxGrid context sharing requires a Plus/Advantage license per endpoint shared through pxGrid to remain in compliance. Is ISE not performing active authentication in your deployment? See here:https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/guide-c07-656177.html#214Contextexchangelicensingrequirements\\n\\nNote:Each active endpoint’s context shared with an external system will consume an Advantage license. Each active endpoint session information shared with an external system will need a 1:1 Advantage license. For example, when a Windows laptop authenticates via 802.1X, one Essentials license is consumed. If this endpoint’s context is shared with Cisco Stealthwatch or NGFW, one additional Advantage license will be consumed. |||| Hello,\\nStill not clear because I have more base licenses than plus licenses and no warnings of out of compliance so this tells me that I can have the bare minimum of plus just to keep pxgrid working.\\nIs there any document that describes what happens when you do no renew a plus license? for exemple, I believe my pxgrid use will be out of compliance for 45 days and then the setting will still be there but as read only and I cannot do anything new.\\nWould that be correct? Hello,\\nI have Cisco ISE 2.7 in HA (VMs) with 25000 Base licenses and Device admin license.\\nI have a question regarding licensing: If we do not upgrade to version 3.1 should we be able to use ISE after October 31 2023?\\n |||| Smart Licensing is available on 2.7 as well.

Hi All,We are upgrading our 2.7 deployment to 3.1 patch 4. Will there be any licensing issues while doing the upgrade node by node from CLI, since there is a license structure change in 3.x versions? Also, during the upgrade some nodes will be having 2.7 version and others will be having 3.1 version. At this time, will there be any issues? |||| You need to get your license converted to the new model before upgrading as the old licensing model won\\'t work with ISE 3.x. You can rollback to old licensing model if required.\\nYou can refer this document for license conversion. |||| hi@Gouthami Nair, you are correct when you say that there is a change of licensing scheme between ISE 2.X and ISE 3.X versions, you might have to convert the licenses that you have from your 2.7 in valid licenses for 3.1 , please refer tohttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/ise-licensing-guide-og.htmlor contact TAC licensing team in case you need help during these conversions.\\nNow related to your other queries, when you upgrade from a 2.X version to a 3.X version the ISE by default will give you a 90 day trial to convert/acquire the corresponding licensing your environment needs with base on your flows configured , the upgrade can be done in several ways (one including the CLI that you mention) more information can be seen herehttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/3-1/upgrade_guide/HTML/b_upgrade_method_3_1.html, at the end you will have the same result and evaluation trial licensing while upgrading, so having this trial version into account you can have a split environment between 2.7 and 3.1 without no issue during the trial period.\\nRate and comment if that helped you.

Currently I am working on Cisco ISE version 2.3 & planning to upgrade to ISE version 3.1.\\nI have a query on ISE licensing conversion.\\ncurrently I am having 6500 Base (perpetual) & 6000 Plus license(subscription based).\\n1.

Can I use the VM common licenses on ISE VM appliance with version 2.7?\\n |||| 1. 6000 Advantage, 500 Essentials\\n2. Yes, but the VMC license requires Smart Licensing\\nhttps://isedemolab.com/license-calc/ |||| Adding to the provided answer, be aware that also the 500 Essentials licenses will be a subscription after the migration. Hello allI recently took over ISE for my company. We\\'re running version 2.7 and we\\'re looking to upgrade to 3.X. It looks like 3.1.0 is the current recommended.It\\'s been decided that we want to deploy a new environment for the upgrade rather than upgrade the current environment. The reason being it wasn\\'t exactly set up right from the start and it\\'s kind of been frankensteined together since.A few questions about taking this path.1. As far as licensing would the new environment just use trial license while we set up and test the new environment and then move the existing licenses over from the old environment?2. Would it be recommended to migrate existing devices, policies, static profiles, etc and then clean up from there, or start from scratch? In other words, restore or start from scratch? We\\'ve had to manually profile a lot of devices due to old/outdated profiling policies that would need to be modified to correctly profile new devices. |||| Are these virtuals? so you need proper planning and future use.\\nSure ISE 3.1.0 is longtive plan (3.2 on way to deploy)\\nyes you can build new Servers and start Trail and once you ready move the License using smart License portal.\\ndepends on how big the setup is, its just days work, I would create a brand new one from scratch, this way you get the opportunity to clean up any organic profiles that don\\'t need and are not sure can go off.\\nAlso, another part of testing is a major part of after deployment, so test ....test...Monitoring is a key role.\\nAnother last note, before you put them Live make sure have all the patches in place.\\n\\n |||| For 1) it depends how your actual setup is licensed. ISE 3.1 runs with smart licensing. If you are using PAC based licenses you have to migrate them and can install the new deployment fully licensed and phase the old deployment out. If your actual deployment already runs on Smart-Licensing, I would run the new as evaluation and then switch over.\\nFor 2) it depends on what kind of monster you created. If devices, policies and so on are mainly ok, you could migrate them first and then clean up. But I am always a friend of first cleaning up and then migrating. If it is a whole mess, doing a complete new setup is likely the better approach. Hi,Quick question Do I need a license to use Cisco ISE for only Radius authentication with Meraki Wi-Fi devices? |||| Also, if I am only using a Base license, do I get TAC support with that? |||| Any type of ISE usage requires a license. If you are only doing authentication and basic authorization then you need at a minimum the ISE VM license (or hardware appliance) and ISE Essentials licenses. Every concurrent active RADIUS session consumes a license.\\nA support SKU is included with most VM purchases and is required in addition to the aforementioned licenses in order to get TAC support and upgrade entitlement. I want to connect WLC9800 and ISE with TACACS.\\nDocuments I referenced is\\'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless/catalyst-9800-series-wireless-controllers/214490-configure-radius-and-tacacs-for-gui-and.html #anc11\\'.\\nI followed that document, but I connected to WLC with SSH,When ENABLEd\\n\\'%Error in authentication.\\'A phrase appearsIt does not enter ENABLE mode.\\nPlease respond if you have a solution. |||| \\n- Ref :https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless/catalyst-9800-series-wireless-controllers/214490-configure-radius-and-tacacs-for-gui-and.html#anc11      >....Note: in order to use ISE as TACACS+ server, you must have aDevice Administration license package, and either a Base or a Mobility license.

Hi Team,\\nI have a requirement to enable web authentication for guest wifi users from ISE. I would like to know how the license will be consumed. I could see tie essential license will be consumed based on radius session.

Dears,For now we are using 2.0 version. As I know we have to do these steps in order to get 2.7 and higher - 2.0-->2.2-->2.7The question - is there any manipulations with licenses? I mean do we need to convert them to smart, or export and then import.Maybe someone has detailed instruction or upgrade? We have only CLI access to server and the disk usage is 88%. Is there will be any problems with that?I found this one:https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/2-2/upgrade_guide/b_ise_upgrade_guide_22/b_ise_upgrade_guide_22_chapter_010.html |||| What is your server - a VM or hardware appliance? There are restrictions on version support for older server hardware as well as changes in CPU and memory and disk requirements that affect your upgrade path.\\nThe 2.0 PAK-based licenses are still usable on 2.7 - Smart licenses are only required as of 3.0 or later. However, if you are moving to a new server you would need to have them rehosted which requires TAC support. |||| Hi Marvin,We are using VM.As I understand it is easier to up the new server because of different disk and CPU requirements.Is there any tool to export configurations from 2.0 version (authentication rules, access lists, endpoint devices) and import them to a new 2.7 version?

Hi. I have performed a upgrade from ISE2.7 patch7 to ISE3.1 Patch 4. And would like to share some interesting things that happened during this activity. My environment is a two node deployment. I performed the upgrade from cli. Started the upgrade on the secondary admin and then on the primary admin. When I started I hade my licensing reverted to traditional as suggested in the upgrade guide.When I tried do start the gui I was prompted to enter a license file. I supplied a file but that did not help. Contacted Cisco TAC and that was a known bug and I was suggested to apply patch4 that would solve that issue. The patch solved that issue. I then converted the license to smart licensing and it did work.In the logs i could see that my MAB authentication/authorization did not work, Wired-dot1x, Wiredless-dot1x worked and admin logins using radius (PAP) worked as well, BUT not MAB. The cause for this behavior is that the profiling service was disabled during the upgrade. Enabling it the MAB starts working.I just have the basic 3.1 license (Essentials) installed and I am still able to enable and run the Profiling service. |||| You will get licensing alarms for this. Essentials does not include profiling. You need to purchase Advantage. Keep in mind any compliance issues regarding the EULA. |||| For MAB to work you must enable profiling, If I don’t enable profiling i am not able to edit the identity groups containing the MAC addresses I use to group the endpoints connecting.Essentials:RADIUS authentication, authorization, andaccounting, including 802.1X, MACauthentication bypass and easy connect, and webauthentication.The advantage states:Profiling services, including basic asset visibilityand enforcement features.It is confusing.

It\\'s not based on users, it\\'s based on the number of unique endpoints (mac addresses) that will be connected to the network at any given point. ISE maintains these sessions until an endpoint disconnects from the network or times out.The licensing has three tiers, Essential, Advantage, and Premier. The authorization features you use in ISE when authenticating these unique mac address/endpoints will determine which one of the licenses you need.Premier licenses will cover any endpoint authorized with Premier, Advantage, or Essentials features.Advantage licenses will cover any endpoint authorized with Advantage or Essentials features.Essentials licenses will only cover endpoint authorizations with essentials features.\\nThe ISE ordering guide walks through the features and what tier they fall in to.https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/guide-c07-656177.htmlThis thread from Charlie provides a quick reference of feature to license typehttps://community.cisco.com/t5/security-knowledge-base/ise-licensing-quick-access/ta-p/3653471 Good morning .\\nI tried to add a license after reinstalling due to a disk full error in ISE version 2.1, but it was not added due to the following error:\\nfailed validation cannot install device administration license when a base license is not installed\\nWhat should I do? |||| Have you already added the base license back?

These 2x new VM will be the new SAN and new PSN.\\nDeregister the SAN from the existing PAN and shutdown the SAN from the old VM servers.\\nConfigure the SAN in the new VM server with the same CLI configuration of the old SAN.\\nRe-register new SAN to the old PAN.\\nSame procedure will be done for the PSNs.\\n\\nMy question now is about the license as we are using Traditional License.\\n\\nSince I have a new SAN in the 1st phase which means it has a new serial number. Do I need to re-host the license already so that it will match the new serial number of the SAN then import it in the old PAN?\\nWhat will happen if I re-host and import the license during the 2nd phase? Will my ISE service be affected even though the discrepancy is only in the SAN and not the PAN?\\n\\nThank you |||| Why not just vMotion them to the new hosts? |||| Hi@ahollifield, my customer does not want to use the cold migration strategy because they told me it does not work the last time they did that and they want to have at least a minimal downtime that is why we are building a new one in parallel per phases.

There is going to be a month of transition period as we migrate network from 2.4 to 3.1, will the traditional licenses on 2.4 be effected, if we change to common VM and essential, its only for this transition period where we will be running 2.4 with traditional and 3.1 with smart licenses both at the same time.\\n2. we have to reload MnT on 2.4 every month because of a current bug on 2.4, will there be any potential effect on licenses if the reload is done on MnT during transition period.\\n\\nThanks |||| Assuming your traditional licenses are PAK, and the 2.4 deployment is not using smart licensing, then those licenses will be unaffected.

This will require TAC in order to assist with this process. In my experiences TAC has actually suggested to do it post-upgrade. Note that in doing so you will be out of compliance for a short window. However, there should be no harm to features/services/etc. as your nodes would fall under the eval window. However, you will upon logging in see a license warning banner. Overall, from my experiences with migrating the licenses from 2.x to 3.x model everything is smooth and honestly rather easy when working with TAC.
